<h1><font color="white"> Abstract </font></h1>
<p><font color="red"> We are teamdopeness, and our final project was to bring you a website that allowed you to visit some dope places. Each page that we 
have allows you to live vicariously through while they take you on a journey to some pretty dope areas. The interface being the first 
page that you arrive at allows you to pick between 3 different locations, first being Madagascar, second being Oceania, and third being 
Italy. Once you click on these you then travel to their info pages where there are some dope facts and info about them.</font></p>

<h1><font color="blue">Theme</font></h1>
<p><font color="white"> The theme behind our website was travel. Since we know everyone wants to travel and experience new places we figured we would 
try bringing this to life through this website where we introduced you to some dope places that we ourselves have had the experience to travel to.</font></p>
